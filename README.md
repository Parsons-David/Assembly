# Overview

Assembly contains two libraries an x86 Assembly library (formula) and a C library (mystery). The x86 Assembly library prints the formula for (1 + x)^n, using only x86 Assembly instructions. The C library implements a C version of some given assembly code (written in mystery.s).

This Library and Implementation was created for work on [Assignment 3](assembly.pdf) in Professor Russell's Fall 2016 Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University.
