**NOTE TO TA** - information about my interpretation and implementation of the spec can be found on **Pages: # and #** . I like to be through in my documentation but for your convenience I've provided you with the location of information most important to grading.

# Overview

Assembly contains two libraries an x86 Assembly library and a C library. The x86 Assembly library prints the formula for (1 + x)^n, using only x86 Assembly instructions. The C library implements a C version of some given assembly code (written in mystery.s).

This Library and Implementation was created for work on [Assignment 3](assembly.pdf) in Professor Russell's Fall 2016 Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University.
