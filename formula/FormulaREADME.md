# Formula

This directory is made up of two things: x86 assembly that holds nCr and factorial methods and a C library that implements the assembly.

## Formula Library

  Takes 1 arguments from the command line.

  power - used to determine the long form of (1 + x)n, where n is the arguement power.

### NOTES on Formula

My implementation of the Formula is contigent upon the power parameter being a non-negative integer as mentioned in the project spec.


As Per Spec:
My implementation also only **handles integer input or output values up to 32 Bits** but can handle any size input or output values of any other base.
